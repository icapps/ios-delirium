## Installation

Delirium is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Delirium', '~> 2.2'
```

## Features

### Animations

#### Blurred Transition

Add some custom modal transitions to your application. Here is an example of what this transition looks like:

![](Resources/Blur.png)

You can pass all the values of `UIBlurEffectStyle` to the `ActionTransitioningDelegate` class. And here is how you implement this transition.

```swift
let transitionDelegate = ActionTransitioningDelegate()

required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
  super.init(coder: aDecoder)

  transitionDelegate.blurEffectStyle = .Light
  transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate
  modalPresentationStyle = .Custom
}
```

_This transition will only work on iOS 9._

#### Shake

You can shake a UIView with this handy `shake` function.

```swift
let view: UIView = ...

// Shake the view with the default `duration` of 0.07 seconds and a `repeatCount` of 4.
view.shake()

// You can also pass a custom `duration` or `repeatCount` is wanted.
view.shake(repeatCount: 10, duration: 1.0)
```

## Controllers

### Alert

You can present an `NSError` from your `UIViewController` instance. This will present a `UIAlertController` with a title translated by the 'delirium.alert.button.ok' key. And with a description `localizedDescription` from `NSError`.

Here is an example of how it looks:

![](Resources/Error.png)

And here how to implement:

```swift
let error: NSError = ...
presentAlertController(with: error)
```

When you want to present an 'ErrorType' than you'll have to conform to the `AlertError` protocol. This will make sure that the `ErrorType` has a title and a description to show in the alert.

```swift
struct SomeError: AlertError {
  var title: String { return "Some error occured" }
  var description: String { return "This is the reason why some error occured." }
}

let error: SomeError = ...
presentAlertController(with: error)
```

The `presentAlertController` function can have a `retry` closure. When implementing this closure you will get a 'Try again' button in the alert. When tapping this button the closure will be triggered.

```swift
let error: NSError = ...
presentAlertController(withError: error) {
  // Tapped retry.
}
```

The `presentAlertController` function can also have an `ok` closure. This
callback will be triggered when you press the 'ok' button.

```swift
let error: NSError = ...
presentAlertController(withError: error, retry: {
  // Tapped retry.
}, ok: {
  // Tapped ok.
})
```

## Views

### Pie Chart

Show a basic pie chart that has a simple overlay that breaks the pie chart and gives it a clean design.

![](Resources/PieChart.png)

You can easily integrate the `PieChartView` by just extending a `UIView` in your storyboard. But for the hardcore fans, you can also create the view manually. (_like an animal_)

When the view is created you can add some slices to it. A slice contains a value and a color.

```swift
let pieChartView = ...

pieChartView.add(slice: PieChartSlice(value: 12.0, color: UIColor.redColor()))
pieChartView.add(slice: PieChartSlice(value: 8.0, color: UIColor.greenColor()))
```

This will result in a pie chart that has two slices. The **red** slice will take 60% of the pie chart, and the **green** slice will contain 40% of the pie chart.

Next to the slices you can also pass some minor configuration options to the view.

```swift
// This is the overlay color of the circle that is drawn over the center of the pie chart. When giving this color an alpha value the pie chart is broken nicely.
pieChartView.overlayColor = UIColor.blueColor()

// This stroke color is the color that is displayed between the slices.
pieChartView.strokeColor = UIColor.blueColor()

// This is the size of the padding from where the overlay circle will be displayed.
pieChartView.overlayPadding = 20.0
```

### Pin

Present a pin view is really easy with _Delirium_.

![](Resources/Pin.png)

Subclass a `UIView` in your storyboard and set it to `PinView`. This view will
automatically calculate it's own intrinsic content size. So when using the pin
view in you Storyboard you don't have to set a width or a height manually. Make
sure that the pin view isn't to strictly pinned to it's super view.

```swift
pinView.delegate = self
```

When you set the delegate to be the current controller. Than this controller needs to conform to `PinViewDelegate`. Which means that the following method should be implemented.

```swift
func pinView(view: PinView, didEnterPin pin: String) {
    // This method is called whenever your pin code is complete.
    // So when the `numberOfDigitis` matched the pin count.
}
```

You can pass a custom configuration to the `PinView`. Here are some of the options that can be configured:

```swift
    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var keyboardConstraint: KeyboardConstraint! {
        didSet {
            keyboardConstraint.offsetFromKeyboardHeight = 25
        }
    }

    @IBAction func tapOutsideTextfield(_ sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
        textField.resignFirstResponder()
    }
```

Below is an overview of all the different configuration options available.

```swift
/// Define the size of the buttons.
configuration.buttonSize: CGFloat = 60.0
/// Define the font of the buttons.
configuration.buttonFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18.0)
/// Define if you want to see the touch down highlight color.
configuration.allowSelectionFeedback = true
// Define the number of digits you want to enter.
configuration.numberOfDigits = 4
// The title to be displayed in the navigation bar.
configuration.title = "Enter your pin"
// The color of the filled dot at the top of the pin view.
configuration.dotColor = UIColor(red:0.11, green:0.68, blue:0.93, alpha:1.00)
// The color of the stroked dot at the top of the pin view.
configuration.dotStrokeColor = UIColor(red:0.73, green:0.77, blue:0.81, alpha:1.00)
// The color of the stroked pin number button.
configuration.numberStrokeColor = UIColor(red:0.75, green:0.79, blue:0.83, alpha:1.00)
// The color of the highlighted background in the pin number button.
configuration.selectionBackgroundColor = UIColor(red:0.90, green:0.91, blue:0.93, alpha:1.00)
// The color of the background in the pin number button.
configuration.backgroundColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
// The color of the text in the pin number button.
configuration.numberTextColor = UIColor(red:0.01, green:0.13, blue:0.28, alpha:1.00)
/// The color of the stroked clear button.
configuration.clearStrokeColor = UIColor.red
/// The color of the highlighted background in the clear button.
configuration.clearSelectionBackgroundColor = UIColor.lightGray
/// The color of the text in the clear button.
configuration.clearTextColor = UIColor.red
```

You can set the configuration by passing the `configuration` instance to the `pinView` instance.

```swift
let configuration = PinConfiguration()
pinView.configuration = configuration
```

# Keyboard

Simply animate any view with the keyboard by setting the class of a layout constraint.

Take a look at the example. You do not need to implement the viewcontroller like below or sublcass it. Just use the `KeyboardConstraint` class.

Credits to *Stefan Adams* form iCapps!

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!

    @IBAction func tapOutsideTextfield(_ sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
        textField.resignFirstResponder()
    }

}

extension KeyboardViewController: UITextFieldDelegate {

    func textFieldShouldEndEditing(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
        textField.resignFirstResponder()
        return true
    }
}
```
The amount of space beteen the keyboard and your view can be set in storyboard when you select the constraint of class `KeyboardConstraint`

# Font

Easily use UIKit's Dynamic Type and Text Styles with a custom font family. When using Dynamic Type in your apps, your apps will respond to users changing their preferred text size in their iOS device's settings.

Text Styles are a set of styles that make it easier to implement different font sizes and font weights into your app. For example, a headline would default to a semi-bold weight and a 17pt point size while a body would default to a regular weight and a 17pt point size.

The default Dynamic Type when no changes are done by the user is `Large`. Dynamic Types vary from `xSmall` to `xxxLarge`.

Available parameters:
- `family`: The name of the font family to be used as returned by `UIFont.familyNames` or a custom font embedded in the app.
- `style`: The font text style to be used. (e.g. `UIFontTextStyle.headline`)

_Example Usage:_

```swift
// Without using TraitCollection:  
let fontFamilyHeitiSC = "Heiti SC"
let font = UIFont.preferredFont(with: fontFamilyHeitiSC, for: .body)

// Using TraitColletion:
let fontFamilyThonburi = "Thonburi"
let anotherFont = UIFont.preferredFont(with: fontFamilyThonburi, for: style, compatibleWith: traitCollection)

// For a list of available fonts use:
print(UIFont.familyNames)
```
